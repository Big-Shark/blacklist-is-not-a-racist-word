# Blacklist is not a racist word

TL;DR
- Stop calling groups of people with colors
- Blacklist doesn't carry racist connotations so you're just wasting everybody's time

Allowlist and denylist are more descriptive than whitelist and blacklist. Yes, I agree for sure. Let's start using them for new projects.

But, please use your brain before making changes to existing projects. Is it really worth your time? Definitely no. A bigger NO if your motive was from the fact you want to see blacklist or whitelist is a racist word. No. Please don't waste our precious time. Let me tell you why I say so.

First of all, the origins of "blacklist" have nothing to do with racism. It doesn't carry racial connotations at all. And, more importantly, it has never been used as an abusive word against black people. You are just trying to find racism in everyday language. If you're not a racist, you wouldn't come up with this misuse of completely irrelevant terms.

Black, as a color, carries negative connotations across many cultures. This is mostly because we, humans are normally diurnal creatures and fear the darkness at night. Black is often associated with fear as you can see in movies, cartoons, etc. This is reflected in our language as well. Black appears in many negative words. It's not only in English, but also in many other languages. If you start a stupid word hunt, you'll be swamped with millions of words in hundres of languages. Going by your logic, you should be advocating for a repaint of The White House because it's a symbol of white supremacy. You shouldn't be using a red card in a soccer match because it "could" offend Native Americans.

A smarter way to attack this entire messed up situation is to stop calling a certain group of people with color. Don't call people who are scientifically categorized as the Negroid race "black". Stop using "white" as a group of people as well.

Hunting down blacklist or whitelist only reinforces the stereotype. Also, it's simply a waste of time for many developers across the globe. The US is not the center of the world.

Stop the hypocrisy. Focus on the right and the most important thing to do. Stop ridiculous political performance. Stop pretending like you care under-presented groups of people. Please.
